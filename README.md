# job_description_scraper
I was curios to see what are the most common words within a range of about 150 Linkedin job posts under the keyword "Python developer". 
Those are the results.

For the time being I just copied the records of the 150 job posts manually from linkedin since I have no time to build a scraper that allow me to extract the right copy of the post.
